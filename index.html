  <p>
    It was always difficult being <span class="bold">Harry Potter</span> and it isnâ€™t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the <span class="bold">Ministry of Magic</span>, a husband and father of three school-age children. <br> While Harry
    grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes,
    darkness comes from unexpected places.
